## Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)

Data used in the preparation of this GitHub project were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private
partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to
test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other
biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the
progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Data used in preparation of this GitHub project were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design
and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this GitHub project.
A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found [here](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf).

Data collection and sharing for the ADNI project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award
number W81XWH-12-2-0012). ADNI is funded by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of
Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, and through generous contributions from the following: AbbVie,
Alzheimer’s Association; Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen;
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and
Company; EuroImmun; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and its affiliated company Genentech, Inc.; Fujirebio; GE
Healthcare; IXICO Ltd.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson &
Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Lumosity; Lundbeck; Merck & Co., Inc.; Meso
Scale Diagnostics, LLC.; NeuroRx Research; Neurotrack Technologies; Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation; Pfizer Inc.; Piramal Imaging; Servier; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company; and Transition
Therapeutics. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research is providing funds to support ADNI clinical sites
in Canada. Private sector contributions are facilitated by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health
(www.fnih.org). The grantee organization is the Northern California Institute for Research and Education,
and the study is coordinated by the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern
California. ADNI data are disseminated by the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern
California.
